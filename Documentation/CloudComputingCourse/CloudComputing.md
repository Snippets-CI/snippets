CI / CD is an integral part in most companies today. We would like to analyze and compare CI / CD approaches for different cloud services provider and create a comprehensible analysis of each provider with detailed instructions.
We will look at different topics:

- deployment strategies (blue-green deployment, a/b testing, recreate...)
- pipelines (building, testing..) languages and costs
- production / staging environments
- extensions / plugins: sonarcloud, webhooks
- integration with different git cloud providers (github, bitbucket, gitlab)
- diagnostics / information for deployment success / failure / image building
- integration with a project
